<h2>Satellite hacking 101</h2>
In this blog post, I am going to talk about how to download data from weather satellites while they are in orbit when they pass overhead :3. Before we start, we will need a few bits of hardware to receive the signals and get data from the sats using an RTL-SDR.
Before we start, you must understand what an RTL-SDR is. RTL-SDR, or SDR for short, stands for Software Defined Radio. Software-defined radios, in short, let your computer receive radio signals normally ranging from 100 kHz to 1.75 GHz.
A few bits of hardware I recommend are listed below:
  <a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/nesdr-smart-sdr.html">Nooelec NESDR SMArt v5 SDR</a>
  <a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/sawbird-plus-noaa-308.html">Nooelec SAWbird+ LNA</a>
  <a href="https://www.sdrstore.eu/software-defined-radio/instruments/rtl-sdr/rtl-sdr-multipurpose-dipole-antenna-kit-en/">RTL-SDR Multipurpose Dipole Antenna Kit</a>
Now that you understand what hardware we will be using, it's time to understand what satellites we will be receiving data from x3. The satellite I will be covering in this blog post is <a href="https://space.oscar.wmo.int/satellites/view/meteor_m_n2_3">METEOR M2-3</a>, a Russian-based weather satellite that is operated and run by the Russian space agency Roscosmos.
METEOR M2-3 operates an LRPT (Low-rate Picture Transmission) antenna. This is what we will be downloading data from :D. The LRPT transmits a digital signal that I will show you how to demodulate and process the received S File data into nice images :3
Next, we will need to know what software we will use to utilize our SDR. I recommend downloading <a href="https://leshamilton.co.uk/MeteorGIS.htm">this pack of software from Les Hamilton</a>. I recommend downloading "MeteorGIS Suite incorporating SDRSharp v 1910" as that is what I will be using in this post, and make sure to place these files in your main C:/ Drive, otherwise the configs won't work.
List of Software Provided:
  <a href="https://www.stoff.pl">Orbitron</a>
  <a href="https://airspy.com/download/">SDR#</a>
  <a href="https://zadig.akeo.ie">Zadig</a>
  "AMIGOS", Provided by Les Hamilton
  M2_LRPT_Decoder", Provided by Les Hamilton
While you can download some of the above software individually, the pack I have provided comes with all the configs needed to instantly start receiving data, cutting out all the boring config work needed to get Orbitron and SDR# to work together correctly (more on this soon).
Before we get into the main part we need to talk about how to setup ur hardware correctly, it is very very very important that you make sure you know what you are doing when it comes to setting up ur antenna if you dontcorrectly set up ur antenna you will get 0 data the angle length and a few more factors effect how much data you will receive
the type of antenna we will be trying to make is called a V-dipol antenna using the diagram provided as a guid make sure ur antenna is setup as close to the diagram as posable, an extra tip is to make sure ur antennas angle is 120degreese from tip to tip the antennas should be 1 metere appart from eachother
if you have decided to use the Low Noise Amplifier reccomended above make sure to plug it in as close to the RTL-SDR as you can trying to avoid cables between the two, this is to minimise infifewarance and to make sure you get the best signal possible
Now that we have our software and hardware sorted, we can get into the fun part :3
First things first, we will need to download the drivers so our RTL-SDR works with our PC. This is done with <a href="https://zadig.akeo.ie">Zadig</a>. Once installed, Zadig is very straightforward; just select the RTL-SDR device and click install drivers.
Next, we will need to find out when the next pass of the satellite is. To do this, we will use <a href="https://www.stoff.pl">Orbitron</a>, which is provided in the pack above. when you load up orbitron you will be greated by a pop up asking to update passlists, this may happen automaticaly but it is key you make sure ur passlist is always uptodate, next you will see on the right a list of satilites make sure to select METEOR M2-3 then you will see
the predicted orbital path of the satilite you have selected, you will see a line that is the path of the satilite and a circle that is the range of the satilite, the circle is the area in which the satilite will be able to transmit data to you, the line is the path the satilite will take, next while having ORBITRON open, Open SDR# and make sure your RTL-SDR is plugged in and connected to your antenna,Go out side to a place that is away from 
obstructions and set up the antenna, once SDR# is open you will see a drop-down menu on the top left, select "RTL-SDR (USB)" and click "Play". You should now see a spectrum analyzer showing the radio frequencies being received by your RTL-SDR. Tune to the frequency of METEOR M2-3, which is 137.1 MHz. You should see a signal when the satellite is overhead. Next select the signal and ajust SDR#'s gain to make sure the signal is as strong as posable,
on the left hand side of SDR# you will see meteor decoder, you will see a button that says record on the meteor decoder, click this button and you will see a window pop up asking for a file name, name the file and click save, you will see a window pop up with a graph showing the signal strength of the satilite, once the satilite has passed over you will see a window pop up with a file name and a save button, click save and you will see a file with the name you gave it in the folder you selected
once you are done and you have saved the now S File to your hard drive, open M2_LRPT_Decoder and open the S File you saved earlyer, next you will start to see M2_LRPT_Decoder decode the images right infront of ur eyes, once M2_LRPT_Decoder has finished decoding the images you can see the decompiled BMP image, as of right now it will be a black and white image, next open AMIGOS and open the BMP image you saved, you will see AMIGOS start to colour the image infront of ur eyes, once AMIGOS has 
finished colouring the image you will see a full colour image of the satilite data you just received you can also fix the stretch on the image and make the image alittle bigger, congradulations you have recived demodulated and decoded an image from space, you can now share this image with ur friends or post it on social media
